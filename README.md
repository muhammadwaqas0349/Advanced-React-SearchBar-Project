# react-search-bar

Hi everyone. In this Project I made a Searchbar Project that can fetch data from different APIs and, based on data, we can filter-out, our data and can show it to the front-end. I tried to use different methods, starting from Basic to Advanced ones. If you like this project please leave a start for my appreciation. Thanks.
